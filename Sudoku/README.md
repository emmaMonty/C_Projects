This project is a Sudoku solver. It asks the user to input a number for how many spot the user wants filled at the begining. Once the input is enter it generates a board with the number of random spots filled in. Using a backtracking algorithm to see if the board is solvable. If the board is solvable it prints the completed board. If the board is not solvable it prints that it's unsolvable.
